When to use the Factory Design Pattern
- When you don't know ahead of time what class object you might need
	- All of these potential classes need to be part of the same subclass hierarchy
		- same superclass
- To centralize class selection code logic
- When you don't want the user to know about every subclass
- To encapsulate object creation
